                            If Matthew Butterick didn’t exist, it would be necessary to invent him. What’s unusual about
                            the
                            tour de force you’re now holding is that not only is it bold and fresh and original, but
                            also
                            that
                            it’s fully developed: it reads like a fifth edition. It’s smartly reasoned, it’s backed up
                            by
                            years
                            of cultivated expertise, and it’s well written.
                        </h2>
                        <h2>
                            Here’s how to use this book if you’re a supervising lawyer (Sarah) dealing with an associate
                            (Ralph): “Ralph, thanks for the memo. I’m looking forward to reading it. But…” “ Is there a
                            problem?”
                        </h2>
                        <h2>
                            “Well yes. Frankly, I don’t want to read it. You’re underlining case names, you’re putting
                            two
                            spaces after periods, and the font is just ghastly. I could spend 30 minutes making it
                            presentable, but I want the associates who work with me to do that in the first place. Do
                            you
                            own Butterick?”

                            “Huh?”

                            “Butterick. Typography for Lawyers. Here, take my copy home tonight. I’ll need it back
                            tomorrow.
                            Learn this stuff, please. I want all your writing for me to comply with Butterick. Got
                            that?”
                            “Sure, Sarah. Thanks. I’ll see you tomorrow.”
                        </h2>
                        <h2>
                            Tomorrow will be a very new day. Here’s how to proceed if you’re an associate (Leslie)
                            dealing
                            with a supervisor (Russell): “Leslie, I don’t like the formatting of this memo. I want
                            double-spaced Courier. And two spaces after a period!” [Smiling pleasantly.] “You’re
                            kidding!”
                            “No, that’s the way I want documents formatted.”
                        </h2>
                        <h2>
                            [Smiling pleasantly but incredulously.] “Is that just for editing purposes? I mean, we’re
                            about
                            to send this off to the client!” “That’s the final format for transmitting it to the
                            client.”
                            [He would say transmitting, wouldn’the?] “Russ, bear with me. You’re the partner here, but
                            haven’t you read Butterick? I really think we should follow Butterick. It makes the firm
                            look
                            better.” “Who the hell is Butterick?” “You know, Typography for Lawyers. He’s the guy who
                            sets
                            the standards for document design in law offices. He makes a good case that most lawyers are
                            completely in the dark about typography. Here, have a look at it.” Russell demurs.
                        </h2>
                        <h2>
                            “Really, Russ, I was shocked to learn that there should be only one space after a period. He
                            makes an irrefutable case. Here, read just this page.” [Be sure to say /ir-ref-yə-tə-bəl/,
                            for
                            credibility’s sake.] [Russell reads.] “I don’t care. I want double-spaced Courier. And two
                            spaces after a period.” “OK, Russ.” [Beaming enthusiastically.] “But I’m telling you, you’ve
                            got
                            to read Butterick.”

                            Here’s how to proceed if you’re on a committee that will be producing a report. At the tail
                            end
                            of the first meeting, as people are packing up, you say: “Can we make everyone’s life easier
                            with just one ground rule? We will follow Butterick in all our drafts and in the final
                            report.OK?” “Butterick?” “Sure. Typography for Lawyers. It’ll make our committee work so
                            much
                            more pleasant when we’re exchanging drafts. You don’t know Butterick? I’ll get you a copy.
                            Believe me: it’ll change your life. You’ll wonder how you ever did without it.” “You’re
                            kidding.” “Absolutely not. You’d do well to learn Butterick!” Please remember these bits of
                            dialogue. Adapt them. Use them. Often. Is Butterick infallible? No: in hierarchical
                            headings, he
                            recommends three-level decimals. But otherwise he’s assuredly infallible.
